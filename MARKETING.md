## Launch Week Posts

### Reddit Post #1 (r/shopify or r/ecommerce)

**Title:** I was terrified of sales tax compliance so I built something to help

**Body:**
Hey everyone,

Like a lot of you, I started selling online without really understanding sales tax. Then I learned about "economic nexus" and panicked. I didn't know if I owed taxes in 3 states or 30.

TaxJar wanted $99/month. I'm a side hustler - that's more than my hosting costs!

So I built Sails (sails.tax) - a simple sales tax tool that:
- Shows you which states you actually have nexus in
- Calculates tax with product categories
- Reminds you before filing deadlines
- Connects to Shopify/WooCommerce/etc.

Free tier available, paid plans start at $9/mo.

Would love feedback from the community. What features would make this actually useful for you?

### Reddit Post #2 (r/smallbusiness)

**Title:** PSA: If you sell online, you probably owe sales tax in states you've never been to

**Body:**
This blew my mind when I first learned it.

After the 2018 South Dakota v. Wayfair Supreme Court case, almost every state can now require you to collect sales tax if you hit certain thresholds - usually $100K in sales OR 200 transactions.

This is called "economic nexus." You don't need a warehouse or employees in a state. Just sales.

I built a free tool to check your nexus status: sails.tax

You can see which states you might owe in based on your sales. No signup required for the calculator.

Happy to answer questions about sales tax - learned a lot building this!

### Product Hunt Tagline Options

1. "Sales tax compliance for small sellers. Half the price of TaxJar."
2. "Stop guessing about sales tax. Start knowing."
3. "The sales tax tool that doesn't require an accounting degree."

### Twitter Thread

🧵 I spent 6 months terrified of sales tax. Then I learned how it actually works.

Here's what every online seller needs to know (thread):

1/ The 2018 Wayfair ruling changed everything. States can now tax you based on where your CUSTOMERS are, not where YOU are.

2/ This is called "economic nexus." Most states trigger it at $100K in sales OR 200 transactions per year in that state.

3/ Yes, you could owe sales tax in 45+ states. Even if you've never set foot there.

4/ The scary part: states are getting better at finding non-compliant sellers. They share data. They send letters. They assess back taxes + penalties.

5/ The good news: If you're not there yet, you can prepare. Track your sales by state. Know when you're approaching thresholds.

6/ I built @SailsTax to make this less terrifying. Free nexus tracking. $9/mo to connect your store.
