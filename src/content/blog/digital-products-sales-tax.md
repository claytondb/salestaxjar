Selling digital products online? The sales tax rules are more complicated than you might expect. While physical goods have relatively straightforward tax treatment, digital products exist in a patchwork of state regulations that can trip up even experienced sellers.

## What Counts as a Digital Product?

Digital products are goods delivered electronically, without any physical component. Common examples include:

- **Software**: Downloaded apps, SaaS subscriptions, plugins
- **Digital media**: Ebooks, music, movies, audiobooks
- **Online courses**: Video courses, webinars, educational content
- **Digital art**: Stock photos, graphics, fonts, templates
- **Gaming**: Downloaded games, in-app purchases, virtual goods

The key distinction: if the customer receives something via download or streaming rather than a physical shipment, it's likely a digital product.

## Do States Tax Digital Products?

Here's where it gets complicated. **Each state decides independently** whether to tax digital goods, and the rules vary wildly.

### States That Tax Digital Products

As of 2026, these states generally tax digital goods:

- **Always taxed**: Texas, Washington, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Louisiana, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin, and others
- **Most digital goods taxed**: Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, New York, Ohio, South Carolina

### States That Don't Tax Digital Products

Several states exempt most or all digital goods:

- **Generally exempt**: California, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Nevada, Virginia
- **No sales tax at all**: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon

### States With Partial Rules

Many states have nuanced rules that depend on the specific type of digital product:

- **Illinois**: Taxes streaming but not downloads
- **New York**: Taxes pre-written software but not custom software
- **Texas**: Taxes most digital products but exempts digital books

## Why the Rules Are So Inconsistent

Sales tax laws were written decades ago for physical goods. When digital products emerged, states had to decide how existing rules applied to intangible items. Some states updated their laws explicitly; others rely on interpretations of old statutes.

This creates situations where:
- An ebook is taxed in one state but not another
- Streaming music is treated differently than downloading music
- Software as a Service (SaaS) has its own separate rules

## Special Case: SaaS and Cloud Services

Software as a Service (SaaS) has become its own tax category. Rules are changing rapidly:

### States That Tax SaaS

Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, and others tax SaaS subscriptions.

### States That Don't Tax SaaS

California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Nevada, and many others exempt SaaS.

### The Trend

More states are moving toward taxing SaaS and cloud services. If you sell subscriptions, keep an eye on law changes.

## How to Determine Taxability

For each digital product you sell, you need to answer:

1. **Where is the customer located?** Digital product taxes are destination-based.
2. **Does that state tax digital products?** Check the state's current rules.
3. **What type of digital product is it?** The specific category matters in many states.
4. **Are there any exemptions?** Some buyers (businesses, nonprofits) may be exempt.

This analysis needs to happen for every sale, which is why many sellers use automated tax tools.

## Sourcing Rules for Digital Products

Unlike physical goods shipped from a warehouse, digital products don't have a clear origin point. States use different approaches:

- **Customer location**: Most states tax based on where the customer is located (billing address or IP address)
- **Business location**: A few states look at where your business is based

Best practice: use the customer's billing address as the sourcing location.

## Economic Nexus for Digital Sellers

Selling digital products doesn't exempt you from economic nexus rules. If you sell over $100,000 (or 200 transactions) into a state, you likely have nexus and need to collect tax, even if you're purely digital with no physical presence.

This catches many digital sellers off guard. Selling ebooks from your home in Florida? Once you pass the threshold in Pennsylvania, you need to register and collect Pennsylvania sales tax on applicable digital sales.

## Practical Steps for Digital Product Sellers

### Step 1: Understand What You Sell

Categorize your products:
- Is it a download or streaming?
- Is it software, media, or educational content?
- Is it a subscription or one-time purchase?

### Step 2: Map Your Customer Base

Where are your customers located? Export your sales data and analyze it by state. Focus on your top-selling states first.

### Step 3: Research State Rules

For each state where you have significant sales:
- Does the state have sales tax?
- Does it tax digital products?
- Does it tax your specific product type?

### Step 4: Track Nexus Thresholds

Monitor your sales by state. When you approach $100,000 or 200 transactions, you likely need to register.

### Step 5: Register and Collect

Once you have nexus and sell taxable digital products in a state:
1. Register for a sales tax permit
2. Configure your checkout to collect tax
3. File returns on the required schedule

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Assuming Digital = Exempt

Many sellers assume digital products are never taxed. This is false. Multiple states actively tax digital goods.

### Using Physical Addresses for Sourcing

For digital products, don't source to a warehouse or office address. Use the customer's location.

### Ignoring Subscriptions

Recurring digital subscriptions create ongoing nexus exposure. A monthly SaaS fee means twelve taxable transactions per customer per year.

### Forgetting Marketplace Facilitation

If you sell through platforms like Amazon, Apple, or Google, check if they collect tax on your behalf. Many marketplaces now handle sales tax as the marketplace facilitator.

## When to Get Help

Digital product taxation is genuinely complex. Consider professional help when:

- You sell multiple product types across many states
- You're launching a new digital product line
- You receive a notice from a state tax authority
- Your business model changes significantly

Tools like Sails can help track your nexus exposure and identify which sales are taxable, but complex situations may need a tax advisor.

## The Future of Digital Taxation

More states are expanding taxation to digital products and services. The trend is clear: as the economy becomes more digital, states want to capture that revenue.

Stay informed by:
- Subscribing to state tax newsletters
- Using tools that track law changes
- Reviewing your obligations at least annually
