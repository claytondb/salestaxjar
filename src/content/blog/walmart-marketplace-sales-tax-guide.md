# Walmart Marketplace Sales Tax Guide for Sellers (2026)

Walmart Marketplace has become a major player in e-commerce, offering sellers access to millions of customers. But with that opportunity comes the responsibility to understand sales tax. Here's everything you need to know about sales tax as a Walmart Marketplace seller in 2026.

## How Walmart Handles Sales Tax Collection

**Good news:** Walmart is a **marketplace facilitator** in all states with marketplace facilitator laws. This means:

- Walmart automatically calculates and collects sales tax on your behalf
- Walmart remits the collected tax to state tax authorities
- You don't need to collect sales tax on Walmart Marketplace sales

This is similar to how Amazon and eBay handle sales tax for their third-party sellers.

## What Walmart Collects For You

Walmart handles sales tax collection for:

- **All marketplace sales** - Any sale made through walmart.com
- **All 45 states** with sales tax (plus D.C.)
- **Local taxes** - City and county taxes where applicable
- **Special district taxes** - Transportation districts, etc.

## Your Remaining Responsibilities

Even though Walmart collects sales tax, you still have some responsibilities:

### 1. Product Tax Categories

Ensure your products are categorized correctly in Walmart Seller Center. Tax rates vary by product type:

| Category | Typical Treatment |
|----------|-------------------|
| Clothing | Exempt or reduced in some states |
| Food/Grocery | Often exempt or reduced |
| Electronics | Standard rate |
| Digital goods | Varies widely by state |

### 2. Multi-Channel Selling

If you sell through other channels, you're still responsible for:

- **Your own website** - Direct sales require you to collect tax
- **Other platforms** - Check if they're marketplace facilitators
- **Local/in-person sales** - You must collect and remit

### 3. Sales Tax Registration

Even with Walmart handling collection, you may still need to:

- Register for sales tax permits in nexus states
- File $0 returns (some states require this)
- Report Walmart sales on your tax returns

## Nexus Considerations for Walmart Sellers

### Economic Nexus

Walmart handling collection doesn't eliminate your nexus. If you exceed state thresholds (typically $100K in sales or 200 transactions), you have economic nexus.

**Common thresholds:**

| Threshold | States |
|-----------|--------|
| $100K sales | Most states |
| $500K sales | CA, TX, NY (higher thresholds) |
| 200 transactions | Some states still use this |

### Physical Nexus

You have physical nexus if you have:

- Inventory in a state (your warehouse, FBA-style fulfillment)
- Employees or contractors in a state
- A physical office or store

## Reporting Walmart Sales

### Monthly/Quarterly Reports

Download your sales tax reports from Walmart Seller Center:

1. Go to **Insights & Analytics**
2. Select **Payments**
3. Download your **Settlement Reports**

These reports show:
- Gross sales by state
- Tax collected by Walmart
- Net proceeds to you

### For Your Tax Returns

When filing state sales tax returns:

- Report Walmart sales in the marketplace facilitator section
- Enter $0 for tax collected (Walmart collected it)
- Keep records to prove marketplace sales

## Common Questions

### Do I need a sales tax permit if I only sell on Walmart?

It depends on the state. Some states require registration even if you have no collection responsibility. Others don't require it if all sales are through marketplace facilitators. Check with each state where you have nexus.

### What about returns and refunds?

Walmart handles tax refunds automatically when customers return items. The refunded tax is deducted from your next settlement.

### How do I handle exemptions?

Exempt customers (resellers, nonprofits) can provide exemption certificates through Walmart. The sale will be processed tax-free, and you don't need to do anything extra.

### What about Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS)?

If you use WFS, Walmart stores your inventory in their fulfillment centers. This can create physical nexus in those states. However, since Walmart collects tax anyway, this mainly matters for:

- States with additional reporting requirements
- Your income tax obligations

## Comparison: Walmart vs. Other Marketplaces

| Feature | Walmart | Amazon | eBay |
|---------|---------|--------|------|
| Collects in all states | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Handles remittance | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Seller tax reports | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Exemption handling | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Tips for Walmart Sellers

### 1. Keep Clean Records

Even though Walmart handles collection:
- Download monthly settlement reports
- Save them for at least 4 years
- Reconcile with your accounting software

### 2. Stay Registered Where Needed

Some states require active registrations for reporting. Check:
- States where you have physical presence
- States with strict reporting requirements

### 3. Monitor for Changes

Sales tax laws change frequently. Subscribe to updates from:
- Sails blog for marketplace news
- Your tax professional
- State tax authority newsletters

### 4. Consider Multi-Channel Complexity

If you sell on multiple platforms plus your own site, you may need sales tax software for the direct sales portion. Sails can help you [calculate rates](/calculator) and track [nexus obligations](/dashboard).

## Getting Started on Walmart Marketplace

Already selling on Walmart? Great! Make sure you:

1. ✓ Verify your product categories are correct
2. ✓ Download and save your tax reports monthly
3. ✓ Check registration requirements in nexus states
4. ✓ Understand your obligations for other sales channels

Not yet a Walmart seller? Apply at [marketplace.walmart.com](https://marketplace.walmart.com). The approval process typically takes 2-4 weeks.

## Conclusion

Selling on Walmart Marketplace is relatively simple from a sales tax perspective thanks to marketplace facilitator laws. Walmart handles the heavy lifting of calculating, collecting, and remitting sales tax. Your job is to keep good records, ensure proper product categorization, and manage compliance for any non-marketplace sales.
