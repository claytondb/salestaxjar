Understanding economic nexus thresholds is crucial for any online seller. Since the 2018 *South Dakota v. Wayfair* Supreme Court decision, states can require you to collect sales tax even without a physical presence — if you exceed their economic nexus threshold.

This comprehensive guide covers every state's current thresholds, updated for 2026.

## Quick Reference: States by Threshold Type

### States with $100,000 Sales Threshold Only (Most Common)

The majority of states use a simple $100,000 gross sales threshold:

- Alabama
- Arizona
- Arkansas
- Colorado
- Florida
- Georgia
- Hawaii
- Idaho
- Illinois
- Indiana
- Iowa
- Kentucky
- Louisiana
- Maine
- Maryland
- Massachusetts
- Michigan
- Minnesota
- Mississippi
- Missouri
- Nebraska
- Nevada
- New Jersey
- New Mexico

- Rhode Island
- South Carolina
- South Dakota
- Tennessee

### States with Higher Thresholds ($500,000)

A few states have higher thresholds, giving small sellers more runway:

| State | Threshold |
|-------|-----------|
| **California** | $500,000 gross revenue |
| **Texas** | $500,000 gross revenue |

### States Requiring Both Sales AND Transaction Count

Some states require you to meet **either** a dollar amount **or** a transaction count:

| State | Sales OR | Transactions |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **New York** | $500,000 | AND 100 transactions |
| **Connecticut** | $100,000 | AND 200 transactions |

**Note:** New York is unique — you must meet *both* the $500,000 AND 100 transaction thresholds, not just one.

### States with No Sales Tax

These five states have no state-level sales tax, so economic nexus doesn't apply:

- **Alaska** (but some local jurisdictions do collect sales tax)
- **Delaware**
- **Montana**
- **New Hampshire**
- **Oregon**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What sales count toward the threshold?

Generally, only sales delivered to customers in that state count. This includes:
- Taxable sales
- Non-taxable sales (like wholesale)
- Exempt sales

Most states look at gross sales, not net sales. Returns and refunds may or may not reduce your count, depending on the state.

### Are marketplace sales included?

It depends on the state. Many states:
- **Include** marketplace sales for determining if you have nexus
- **Exclude** them from your direct collection responsibility (since the marketplace collects)

This means selling $90,000 directly + $20,000 on Amazon could trigger nexus in a $100,000 threshold state, even though Amazon remits the tax on their portion.

### When do I need to start collecting?

Most states give you 30-60 days after crossing the threshold to register and begin collecting. Don't wait — register promptly to avoid penalties.

### What's the penalty for not collecting?

Penalties vary by state but can include:
- Back taxes owed on uncollected sales
- Interest (typically 10-12% annually)
- Penalties (often 10-25% of tax owed)
- In extreme cases, personal liability

### Do thresholds reset each year?

Yes. Most states calculate thresholds based on the current or previous calendar year. If you exceeded the threshold last year, you typically have nexus for the entire current year.

### How do I track my sales by state?

Use your e-commerce platform's built-in reporting, or tools like Sails that aggregate sales across all your platforms and alert you when you're approaching thresholds.
