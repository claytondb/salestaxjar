# Dropshipping Sales Tax Guide: What Sellers Need to Know

Dropshipping is one of the most popular e-commerce models—you sell products without holding inventory, and your supplier ships directly to customers. But when it comes to sales tax, dropshipping creates unique complications that trip up even experienced sellers.

This guide covers everything dropshippers need to know about sales tax compliance.

## How Sales Tax Works in Dropshipping

In a traditional retail model, the flow is simple: you buy inventory, store it, sell it, and ship it to customers. Sales tax applies at the point of sale.

Dropshipping adds a third party—your supplier. Here's the typical flow:

1. **Customer orders** from your online store
2. **You purchase** the item from your supplier
3. **Supplier ships** directly to your customer

This creates a question: who's responsible for collecting sales tax?

**The answer**: Usually **you**, the retailer, are responsible for collecting sales tax from your customers. Your supplier is a separate transaction—a wholesale purchase from you.

## The Two Sales Tax Transactions

Every dropship order actually involves two potential sales tax events:

### Transaction 1: You → Supplier (Wholesale)

When you buy from your supplier, this is typically a wholesale transaction. If you have a valid **resale certificate**, you don't pay sales tax on this purchase because you're buying for resale, not personal use.

**Important**: You need resale certificates for each state where your supplier has nexus and where you might have orders shipped.

### Transaction 2: You → Customer (Retail)

This is where sales tax typically applies. If you have nexus in your customer's state, you must collect and remit sales tax on the retail sale.

## When Do You Have Nexus as a Dropshipper?

Even without inventory or a physical location, you can still have sales tax nexus through:

### Economic Nexus

Most states have **economic nexus** thresholds—typically $100,000 in sales or 200 transactions per year in the state. Once you exceed these thresholds, you must collect sales tax in that state.

Common thresholds:
- **California**: $500,000 in sales
- **Texas**: $500,000 in sales
- **New York**: $500,000 in sales AND 100 transactions
- **Most other states**: $100,000 in sales OR 200 transactions

### Where Your Supplier Ships From

Here's the tricky part: in some states, your supplier's location can create nexus for **you**.

Some states consider the supplier's warehouse as creating nexus for the retailer (you). This is called "drop shipment nexus" and applies in states like:

- California
- Florida
- Texas
- Pennsylvania
- Others

**Bottom line**: If your supplier has a warehouse in a state, you may need to collect sales tax on orders shipped to that state—even if you've never set foot there.

## Marketplace Sellers vs. Your Own Store

If you dropship through a **marketplace** like Amazon, eBay, or Etsy, the rules are different.

### Marketplace Facilitator Laws

In all 50 states with sales tax, **marketplace facilitators** (Amazon, eBay, Etsy, etc.) are required to collect and remit sales tax on your behalf.

This means:
- **On Amazon/eBay/Etsy**: The marketplace handles sales tax collection
- **On your Shopify/WooCommerce store**: YOU handle sales tax collection

If you sell through both channels, you need to track nexus and collect tax only for your direct sales—not marketplace sales.

## Resale Certificates: Your Key Tool

A **resale certificate** is a form that proves you're buying goods for resale, not personal use. When you provide this to your supplier, they don't charge you sales tax on your wholesale purchases.

### How to Get a Resale Certificate

1. **Register for a sales tax permit** in your home state (or states where you have nexus)
2. **Apply for a resale certificate** from your state's tax authority
3. **Provide copies** to all your suppliers

### Important Notes

- Resale certificates are **state-specific**—you may need certificates from multiple states
- Some states accept out-of-state certificates; others don't
- Keep copies on file—suppliers may request them for audits
- Never use a resale certificate for personal purchases—it's fraud

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up Sales Tax for Dropshipping

### Step 1: Determine Your Nexus

Ask yourself:
- Where is my business located? (Home state = automatic nexus)
- Where are my suppliers' warehouses?
- Have I exceeded economic nexus thresholds in any states?

### Step 2: Register for Sales Tax Permits

Register in every state where you have nexus. You can:
- Register directly with each state
- Use the **Streamlined Sales Tax Registration System** (24 states) for bulk registration

### Step 3: Get Resale Certificates

Obtain resale certificates and provide them to all suppliers.

### Step 4: Configure Your Store

Set up your e-commerce platform to collect the correct sales tax:
- **Shopify**: Built-in sales tax collection
- **WooCommerce**: Use a tax plugin or service like Sails
- **BigCommerce**: Automatic tax calculation available

### Step 5: Track and Remit

- Track all taxable sales by state
- File returns and remit collected tax according to each state's schedule
- Monthly, quarterly, or annual filing depends on your sales volume

## Common Dropshipping Sales Tax Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Collecting Tax Because "I Don't Have Inventory"

**Wrong**. Nexus isn't just about physical presence—economic nexus and drop shipment nexus can apply.

### Mistake 2: Using Personal Purchases as Resale

Using a resale certificate for personal items is tax fraud. Only use it for inventory you'll actually resell.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Marketplace Sales for Nexus Calculation

Even though marketplaces collect tax for you, those sales still count toward your economic nexus thresholds in most states.

### Mistake 4: Not Getting Certificates from All Suppliers

If you use multiple suppliers, get resale certificates on file with each one. Otherwise, you're paying unnecessary sales tax on wholesale purchases.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting About Filing Requirements

Even if you collected $0 in sales tax, many states require you to file a "zero return." Missing these can result in penalties.

## Dropshipping From Overseas Suppliers

If your supplier is based overseas (common with AliExpress or Alibaba dropshipping):

- **Imports under $800**: Duty-free for the customer under *de minimis* rules
- **Sales tax still applies**: Even though no import duty is charged, you're still responsible for collecting sales tax on the retail sale
- **No resale certificate needed**: Since the supplier is overseas, no U.S. sales tax applies to your wholesale purchase

## Working With Multiple Suppliers

Many dropshippers work with several suppliers across different states. This can create nexus in multiple states.

**Best practice**: Maintain a list of all supplier warehouse locations and check each one against your nexus obligations.

## Key Takeaways

1. **You're responsible** for collecting sales tax on retail sales—not your supplier
2. **Use resale certificates** to avoid paying sales tax on wholesale purchases
3. **Economic nexus** means you may owe tax in states where you've never been
4. **Supplier locations** can create nexus for you in some states
5. **Marketplace sales** are handled by the marketplace—but still count for nexus
6. **Track everything** and file returns on time, even if they're zero

## FAQs

**Q: Do I need a resale certificate if I only use overseas suppliers?**
A: No—resale certificates are only needed for U.S. suppliers.

**Q: What if my supplier charges me sales tax even though I have a certificate?**
A: Contact them with a copy of your certificate. If they're still charging tax, you may need to provide a state-specific form.

**Q: Do I need a business license to dropship?**
A: A business license is separate from sales tax registration. Most jurisdictions require some form of business registration, but requirements vary.

**Q: Can I collect sales tax before I'm registered?**
A: No—you must be registered in a state before you can legally collect sales tax there. Once registered, remit what you collected.
