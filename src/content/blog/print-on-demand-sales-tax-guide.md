# Print-on-Demand Sales Tax Guide: Printful, Printify & More (2026)

Print-on-demand (POD) businesses have exploded in popularity. Create a design, upload it, and let fulfillment companies handle production and shipping. But where does sales tax fit in? It depends on your sales channels and which POD provider you use.

## How Print-on-Demand Works (Tax Perspective)

In a POD business:

1. **You** create designs and list products
2. **Customer** places an order on your store/marketplace
3. **POD provider** prints and ships the product
4. **Someone** needs to handle sales tax

That "someone" depends on your setup.

## Major POD Providers and Sales Tax

### Printful

**Printful is a marketplace facilitator** for orders they collect payment on. This means:

- If you use Printful's built-in stores or Printful handles checkout → Printful collects and remits tax
- If you connect Printful to Shopify/Etsy/etc. → See the integration section below

### Printify

**Printify does NOT collect sales tax** (as of 2026). They're a production partner only.

- You must collect sales tax through your sales platform
- Printify just fulfills the order
- Tax responsibility is entirely yours (or your platform's)

### Gooten

Similar to Printify:
- Gooten is a fulfillment partner, not a marketplace facilitator
- You handle tax collection through your sales channel

### SPOD (Spreadshirt)

- SPOD integrates with platforms that handle tax
- For direct SPOD sales, they may collect tax depending on your setup

### Redbubble / TeePublic / Society6

These are **marketplace facilitators**:
- They collect and remit sales tax on all orders
- You just receive your profit share
- No sales tax action needed from you

## Tax by Sales Channel

Here's where it gets practical. Your sales tax responsibility depends on where customers buy:

### Etsy + POD

**Etsy is a marketplace facilitator.**

- Etsy collects and remits sales tax on all orders
- Doesn't matter which POD provider you use
- Your responsibility: $0 sales tax collection

### Shopify + POD

**Shopify is NOT a marketplace facilitator.**

- You must set up sales tax collection in Shopify
- Shopify can calculate tax automatically
- You're responsible for remitting tax to states

With Shopify + Printful/Printify:
1. Customer pays you (including tax) via Shopify
2. You pay Printful/Printify for production
3. You remit collected tax to states

### Amazon + POD (Merch on Demand)

**Amazon is a marketplace facilitator.**

- Amazon collects and remits sales tax
- Merch by Amazon (now Merch on Demand) is fully handled
- No action needed from you

### WooCommerce + POD

**WooCommerce is self-hosted** (not a marketplace).

- You're responsible for sales tax
- Use WooCommerce tax plugins or Sails integration
- You must register, collect, and remit

### Your Own Website + POD

If you run your own store:
- You're fully responsible for sales tax
- Use a tax calculation service (like Sails)
- Register in states where you have nexus

## State-by-State Considerations

### Clothing Exemptions

Many states have special rules for clothing:

| State | Clothing Tax |
|-------|--------------|
| Pennsylvania | Exempt |
| New Jersey | Exempt |
| New York | Exempt under $110/item |
| Minnesota | Exempt |
| Massachusetts | Exempt under $175/item |

This matters for POD because most products are apparel!

### Product Categories

POD products have varying tax treatment:

| Product | Usually Taxable? |
|---------|------------------|
| T-shirts | Yes (standard rate) |
| Hoodies | Yes |
| Mugs | Yes |
| Posters | Yes |
| Canvas prints | Yes (may be considered art in some states) |
| Stickers | Yes |

## Nexus for POD Sellers

### Economic Nexus

You create economic nexus by selling TO customers in a state. Thresholds are typically:

- $100,000 in sales, OR
- 200 transactions

Once exceeded, you must collect sales tax in that state (unless a marketplace facilitator handles it).

### Physical Nexus Considerations

POD creates an interesting physical nexus question: **Does inventory in a POD facility create nexus?**

Generally, no, because:
- POD products are made to order
- You don't pre-stock inventory
- The POD provider owns the production materials

However, consult a tax professional for your specific situation.

## Practical Workflows

### Workflow 1: Etsy-Only POD Seller

1. Create designs
2. List on Etsy
3. Connect to Printful/Printify
4. **Sales tax: Etsy handles it all** ✓
5. Focus on design and marketing

### Workflow 2: Shopify + Printful

1. Set up Shopify store
2. Configure sales tax in Shopify Settings
3. Register for sales tax in nexus states
4. Connect Printful
5. **Shopify collects tax, you remit quarterly/monthly**
6. Download Shopify tax reports for filing

### Workflow 3: Multi-Channel (Etsy + Shopify + Amazon)

1. Etsy sales → Etsy collects tax ✓
2. Amazon sales → Amazon collects tax ✓
3. Shopify sales → YOU collect and remit tax
4. Track nexus across all channels combined
5. File returns covering all channels

## Record Keeping

Keep these records for each sale:

- Order date
- Customer location (state, county, city)
- Product sold
- Tax collected (if any)
- Marketplace facilitator (if applicable)

Most platforms provide downloadable reports. Save them!

## Common POD Tax Questions

### Do I need a resale certificate?

**For buying from POD providers:** Generally, no. You're buying a finished product for resale (the POD fulfillment). The POD provider is providing a manufacturing service.

**For selling to resellers:** If a customer provides a resale certificate, you can sell tax-exempt.

### What about international sales?

- POD providers often handle VAT for EU sales
- Canada: Check provincial requirements
- Other countries: Research local requirements

### Do I need business registration to sell POD?

Not necessarily for sales tax purposes, but:
- States may require business registration
- You'll need an EIN for tax purposes eventually
- Check your state's requirements

### What about design services?

If you sell design services (not physical products):
- Different tax rules apply
- Some states don't tax services
- This is separate from POD product sales

## Setting Up Sales Tax for POD

### Step 1: Identify Your Sales Channels

List everywhere you sell:
- Marketplaces (Etsy, Amazon, eBay, Redbubble)
- Self-hosted stores (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce)

### Step 2: Determine Collection Responsibility

For each channel:
- Marketplace? → They collect
- Self-hosted? → You collect

### Step 3: Calculate Nexus

Add up ALL sales by state (from all channels):
- Do you exceed $100K or 200 transactions anywhere?
- That's where you have nexus

### Step 4: Register and Configure

For states where you have nexus AND collection responsibility:
1. Register for a sales tax permit
2. Configure tax collection in your platform
3. Set up filing reminders

### Step 5: File Returns

Even if marketplaces collected most of your tax:
- Some states require you to file $0 returns
- Report marketplace sales separately
- Keep all documentation

## Conclusion

Print-on-demand has made starting a product business easier than ever. The sales tax situation is also manageable:

- **Marketplace sales** (Etsy, Amazon, Redbubble) → Marketplaces handle tax
- **Self-hosted sales** (Shopify, WooCommerce) → You handle tax
- **Track nexus** across all channels combined

Start with the channels that handle tax for you. As you grow into self-hosted sales, set up proper tax collection. And always keep good records!
