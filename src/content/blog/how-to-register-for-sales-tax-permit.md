Once you've determined you have sales tax nexus in a state, your next step is registering for a sales tax permit. This guide covers the registration process for all 45 states that collect sales tax.

## What Is a Sales Tax Permit?

A **sales tax permit** (also called seller's permit, sales tax license, or certificate of authority) is your legal authorization to collect sales tax from customers in a specific state. It's required before you can:

- Legally collect sales tax from customers

- Estimated monthly sales
- Business start date (or date you began selling in the state)
- Bank account information (for some states)

## The Registration Process

### Typical Steps

1. **Gather your information** — Business details, EIN, owner info
2. **Create an account** — Most states have online portals
3. **Complete the application** — Answer questions about your business
4. **Submit** — Electronic submission is fastest
5. **Receive your permit** — Usually by email or mail

### What to Expect After Registration

Once approved, you'll receive:
- Sales tax permit number (needed for tax returns)
- Filing frequency assignment (monthly, quarterly, or annual)
- First return due date
- Online filing account credentials

## Filing Frequency

States assign filing frequency based on your sales volume:

| Sales Volume | Typical Frequency |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Under $1,000/month | Annual or Quarterly |
| $1,000-$10,000/month | Quarterly |
| Over $10,000/month | Monthly |

**New businesses** typically start with quarterly or monthly filing and may be adjusted later.

## Common Registration Questions

### Can I register before I have nexus?

Yes, but it's not recommended. Registering creates "voluntary nexus" and obligates you to collect and remit tax even if you wouldn't otherwise be required to.

### Do I need to register in my home state?

If you have a physical presence (office, inventory, employees) in a state with sales tax, yes. Most e-commerce sellers have nexus in their home state.

### What if I'm selling through Amazon/Etsy/eBay?

For marketplace sales, the **marketplace facilitator** (Amazon, etc.) typically handles tax collection in most states. However, you may still need to register if you:
- Sell on your own website
- Have direct sales outside the marketplace
- The marketplace doesn't collect tax in certain states

### Can I register for multiple states at once?

Yes! The **Streamlined Sales Tax Registration System (SSTRS)** lets you register in up to 24 member states with a single application:

[streamlinedsalestax.org](https://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/Marketplace/Marketplace)

**SSTRS Member States:**
Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

### How long does registration take?

- **Online registration:** Usually same day to 3 business days
- **Paper registration:** 1-4 weeks
- **States with backlogs:** (California, New York, Texas) May take 2-4 weeks

### What if I miss the registration deadline?

Register as soon as possible. Most states:
- Calculate tax owed from the date nexus began
- May waive penalties for voluntary disclosure
- Offer payment plans for back taxes

Consider using a **Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA)** for better terms when registering late.

## Tips for Smooth Registration

### 1. Register Online When Possible

Online registration is:
- Faster
- Provides immediate confirmation
- Creates your filing account automatically

### 2. Keep Records of Everything

Save:
- Registration confirmation
- Permit number
- Username/password for state portal
- Filing frequency and due dates

### 3. Set Up Payment Methods Early

Most states require:
- Bank account for ACH payments
- Some accept credit cards (with fees)

Set this up during registration to avoid delays when filing.

### 4. Mark Filing Deadlines

Add to your calendar:
- Monthly/quarterly/annual due dates
- Annual renewal deadlines (if applicable)
- Prepayment deadlines (some states require these)

## After You're Registered

### Start Collecting Tax

Once registered, you're legally required to:
1. Collect the correct sales tax rate from customers
2. Maintain records of all sales
3. File returns by the due date
4. Remit collected tax to the state

### Display Your Permit

Some states require displaying your permit:
- Physical stores: Post visibly
- Online stores: Include on checkout or policies page

### Stay Compliant

Missing deadlines results in:
- Late filing penalties (typically $50-$500)
- Late payment penalties (often 5-25% of tax due)
- Interest charges
- Potential license revocation
