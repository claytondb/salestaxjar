Running an online store on Wix means you'll eventually face the sales tax question. The good news: Wix has built-in tax tools that handle the basics. The challenge is understanding when you need to collect and how to stay compliant as your business grows.

## Does Your Wix Store Need to Collect Sales Tax?

You need to collect sales tax if you have **nexus** in a state. Nexus means a significant connection to that state through:

- **Physical presence**: A home office, warehouse, employee, or inventory in the state
- **Economic nexus**: Exceeding a state's sales threshold (typically $100,000 in sales or 200 transactions per year)

Most Wix store owners start with nexus only in their home state. As sales grow, you'll likely trigger economic nexus in additional states.

## Wix's Built-In Tax Features

Wix includes automatic tax calculation for US-based stores. Here's what it offers:

- Automatic tax rate calculation based on customer location
- Support for destination-based taxation
- Product tax group settings for different categories
- Tax-inclusive pricing options

### Enabling Automatic Tax Calculation

1. Go to your **Wix Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **eCommerce Settings** > **Tax**
3. Enable **Automatic tax calculation**
4. Set your business location

Wix will calculate sales tax at checkout for orders shipping to states where you've enabled collection.

## Setting Up Tax Collection by State

Only collect sales tax in states where you have nexus:

1. In your **Wix Dashboard**, go to **Settings** > **Tax**
2. Under **Tax regions**, add each state where you have nexus
3. For each state, you can use automatic rates or set custom rates
4. Save your changes

**Important**: Don't enable collection in states where you're not registered. Collecting tax without registration causes legal issues.

## Understanding Wix Tax Regions

Wix uses "tax regions" to manage where and how much tax you collect:

### Automatic vs. Manual Rates

- **Automatic**: Wix calculates rates based on customer address (recommended for US)
- **Manual**: You set fixed rates (useful for countries with simple, flat rates)

For US sellers, automatic calculation handles the complexity of different city, county, and state rates.

### Destination-Based Taxation

Most US states use destination-based taxation, meaning the tax rate depends on where your customer receives the product. Wix handles this automatically when you use automatic tax calculation.

Some states (like Arizona, Illinois, Missouri) use origin-based taxation, where the rate is based on your business location. Make sure your business address is set correctly in Wix.

## Product Tax Groups

Different products have different tax rules. Wix lets you assign products to tax groups:

1. Edit a product in your Wix store
2. Scroll to the **Tax Group** setting
3. Assign the appropriate group

Common considerations:
- **Clothing**: Tax-exempt in some states (PA, NJ, NY under $110)
- **Food**: Often taxed at reduced rates or exempt
- **Digital products**: Taxability varies widely by state

If you sell products with special tax treatment, research the rules for each state where you have nexus.

## Tax-Inclusive Pricing

Wix offers tax-inclusive pricing, where the displayed price includes tax:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Tax**
2. Enable **Tax-inclusive pricing**

This is common in Europe but unusual for US stores. Most US customers expect to see tax added at checkout.

## When to Consider Additional Tax Tools

Wix's built-in tax features work well for simple setups. You might need additional help when:

- You have nexus in multiple states and need detailed reporting
- You need to track economic nexus thresholds
- You want filing-ready reports formatted for state returns
- You need better audit documentation

### How Sails Helps Wix Sellers

Sails connects to your Wix store to import order data, then provides:

- Nexus exposure tracking across all states
- Alerts when you approach economic nexus thresholds
- Filing-ready reports that match state requirements
- A clear picture of your multi-state tax obligations

This doesn't replace Wix's tax calculation—it adds reporting and compliance tools on top.

## Filing Sales Tax Returns

Collecting tax is only part of the equation. You must also file returns and remit the collected tax to each state. Filing schedules depend on your volume:

- **Monthly**: High-volume sellers (typically $300+ in monthly tax)
- **Quarterly**: Medium-volume sellers
- **Annually**: Low-volume sellers

Check each state's Department of Revenue for your assigned filing frequency after registration.

### What Your Filing Needs

State returns typically require:
- Gross sales
- Taxable sales
- Exempt sales
- Tax collected
- Tax due (may differ from collected if you over/under-collected)

Keep good records of all transactions. Wix's order export helps, but dedicated tools like Sails organize this data specifically for filing.

## Common Wix Sales Tax Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Registering Before Collecting

Never collect sales tax in a state until you're registered there. Register first, then enable collection in Wix.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Economic Nexus

Even without physical presence, selling $100,000+ in a state (or 200+ transactions in some states) creates nexus. Track your sales by state and register when you approach thresholds.

### Mistake 3: Incorrect Business Address

Your business address in Wix affects origin-based tax calculations. If you've moved or work from a different location, update it.

### Mistake 4: Missing Tax-Exempt Products

Some products you sell may be tax-exempt in certain states. Clothing in Pennsylvania, groceries in many states—research the rules and configure your tax groups correctly.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Zero-Returns

Even if you collected zero tax in a filing period, most states still require you to file a return. Missing filings trigger penalties.

## Wix Sales Reports

Wix provides order reports that include tax information:

1. Go to **Analytics** > **Reports** in your Wix Dashboard
2. Export your sales data
3. Filter or pivot by state to see tax collected per region

For state filing, you'll likely need to reformat this data. Tools like Sails automate this process.

## Multi-State Selling Tips

As your Wix store grows, you'll deal with more states. Here's how to stay organized:

1. **Track thresholds**: Monitor sales by state; register before hitting nexus thresholds
2. **Register promptly**: Don't delay registration once you have nexus
3. **Keep a calendar**: Note all filing deadlines across states
4. **Document everything**: Save order exports and filing confirmations
5. **Use automation**: Tools like Sails reduce manual tracking

## Getting Help

Sales tax rules change frequently, and each state has unique requirements. If you're uncertain:

- Consult a tax professional for your specific situation
- Check state Department of Revenue websites for official guidance
- Use compliance tools to automate tracking and reporting
