# Amazon Seller Sales Tax Guide: Everything You Need to Know in 2026

Selling on Amazon? Sales tax can feel overwhelming. With inventory spread across FBA warehouses, marketplace facilitator laws, and varying state requirements, it's easy to get confused. This guide breaks down everything Amazon sellers need to know about sales tax compliance.

## The Good News: Marketplace Facilitator Laws

Here's the best news for Amazon sellers: **in most states, Amazon now collects and remits sales tax on your behalf**.

As of 2026, all 45 states with sales tax plus Washington D.C. have marketplace facilitator laws. This means Amazon is responsible for:

- Calculating the correct sales tax rate
- Collecting tax from customers at checkout
- Remitting the tax to state tax authorities
- Filing returns for marketplace sales

**What this means for you:** For most Amazon sales, you don't have to worry about collecting or remitting sales tax. Amazon handles it automatically.

## When You Still Need to Handle Sales Tax

While Amazon collects on most orders, you may still need to manage sales tax yourself in these situations:

### 1. Off-Amazon Sales

If you sell through your own website, other marketplaces, or in-person, you're responsible for sales tax collection on those channels. Amazon's marketplace facilitator status only covers Amazon.com sales.

### 2. B2B Sales and Tax Exemptions

When business customers provide exemption certificates, you may need to:

- Collect and verify exemption certificates
- Report exempt sales separately
- Maintain records for audits

Amazon Business handles some B2B exemptions automatically, but wholesale and certain exempt sales may require your attention.

### 3. Sales to States Without Marketplace Facilitator Laws

This is increasingly rare, but if you sell to U.S. territories or make international sales, different rules may apply.

## Understanding FBA and Sales Tax Nexus

Even though Amazon collects tax, you might still need sales tax permits in various states. Here's why:

### Physical Nexus Through FBA

When you use Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), your inventory is stored in Amazon warehouses across the country. Historically, this created **physical nexus** in every state where your inventory sat.

**Important:** While Amazon now handles collection, some states still require you to register for a sales tax permit if you have nexus there—even if no tax collection is required from you.

### States With Registration Requirements

Check these states for registration requirements even when using FBA:

- **California** - Registration may be required for nexus reporting
- **New York** - Similar registration requirements
- **Pennsylvania** - Ongoing registration rules

**Pro tip:** Check each state's requirements annually, as rules continue to evolve.

## Setting Up Your Amazon Seller Account for Sales Tax

### Step 1: Review Your Tax Settings

1. Go to **Settings > Tax Settings** in Seller Central
2. Verify your business address and legal entity information
3. Confirm Amazon is set to calculate and collect sales tax

### Step 2: Enable Amazon Tax Collection Services

Amazon automatically enables tax collection in marketplace facilitator states, but verify:

1. Navigate to **Tax Settings**
2. Check that "Marketplace Tax Collection" is enabled for applicable states
3. Review product tax codes for your items

### Step 3: Product Tax Codes (PTCs)

Amazon uses Product Tax Codes to determine if your items are taxable or exempt. Common codes include:

| Category | PTC | Tax Status |
|----------|-----|------------|
| General Merchandise | A_GEN_TAX | Taxable |
| Clothing (varies by state) | A_CLOTHING | Varies |
| Groceries | A_FOOD | Often reduced/exempt |
| Baby Items | A_BABY | Varies by state |

Assigning the correct PTC ensures customers pay the right amount of tax.

## Common Amazon Sales Tax Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Ignoring State Registration

Even with Amazon collecting tax, some sellers assume they don't need to do anything. States may still require:

- Business registration
- Annual reports
- Nexus questionnaires

### Mistake #2: Wrong Product Tax Codes

Incorrect PTCs lead to over- or under-charging customers. A $50 item with the wrong code could mean hundreds in errors over time.

### Mistake #3: Not Tracking Multi-Channel Sales

If you sell on Amazon AND your own site, you need separate tracking:

- Amazon handles Amazon.com sales
- You handle direct website sales
- Different systems, same reporting requirements

### Mistake #4: Forgetting About Refunds

When you refund a customer, the sales tax should also be refunded. Amazon handles this automatically for marketplace sales, but track it for your records.

## Record Keeping for Amazon Sellers

Maintain these records for at least 4 years:

1. **Monthly sales reports** from Seller Central
2. **Tax document reports** showing tax collected
3. **Exemption certificates** for B2B customers
4. **Refund records** with associated tax amounts
5. **Inventory placement reports** (for nexus tracking)

### Where to Find Tax Reports in Seller Central

1. Go to **Reports > Tax Document Library**
2. Download monthly **Marketplace Tax Collection** reports
3. Review **Combined Tax Report** for complete picture

## Amazon FBA and Multi-State Compliance

### Tracking Your Inventory Locations

To understand your nexus footprint:

1. Go to **Reports > Fulfillment > Inventory Event Detail**
2. Review which warehouses held your inventory
3. Map warehouse locations to states

### States Where Amazon Has Major FBA Centers

Amazon operates fulfillment centers in nearly all 50 states. Major hubs include:

- California (multiple locations)
- Texas (multiple locations)
- Kentucky
- Indiana
- Pennsylvania
- New Jersey
- Florida
- Arizona

## FAQ

### Do I need a sales tax permit to sell on Amazon?

For Amazon.com sales only, many sellers don't need permits since Amazon collects tax as a marketplace facilitator. However, some states require registration for nexus reporting purposes.

### Does Amazon charge me for collecting sales tax?

No, Amazon's marketplace tax collection service is free. They handle calculation, collection, and remittance at no cost to sellers.

### What if a customer disputes a sales tax charge?

Direct them to Amazon customer service. Since Amazon calculates and collects tax, they handle customer inquiries about tax amounts.

### How do I handle sales tax for Amazon Canada or Amazon UK?

International Amazon marketplaces have different tax systems (GST/HST in Canada, VAT in UK/EU). Each requires separate registration and compliance.

### Should I still register for sales tax permits?

Consider registering in states where you have significant nexus or plan to expand beyond Amazon sales. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.
