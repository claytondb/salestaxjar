Running an online store on Squarespace? At some point, you'll need to tackle sales tax. While Squarespace provides built-in tax tools, knowing how to configure them correctly—and understanding your obligations—is crucial for staying compliant.

This guide walks through everything Squarespace sellers need to know about sales tax setup and compliance.

## Does Squarespace Collect Sales Tax Automatically?

Squarespace provides **automatic tax calculation** for US sellers, but it's not completely hands-off. Here's what you need to understand:

### What Squarespace Does

- Calculates tax rates based on customer location
- Applies the correct combined rate (state + county + city)
- Shows tax separately on checkout and receipts
- Tracks tax collected in your order reports

### What Squarespace Doesn't Do

- Register you for sales tax permits
- File your tax returns
- Determine if you have nexus in a state
- Handle exemption certificates
- Manage remittance to tax authorities

**Bottom line**: Squarespace helps you *collect* the right amount, but you're responsible for determining *when* you should collect and *where* you need to file.

## Setting Up Sales Tax in Squarespace

### Step 1: Enable Tax Collection

1. Go to **Commerce** → **Taxes**
2. Toggle on automatic tax calculation
3. Squarespace will use your business address as the default origin

### Step 2: Configure Your Business Location

Your business address matters for:
- Origin-based states (tax based on where you ship from)
- Nexus determination
- Return filing requirements

Enter your actual business location, even if you work from home.

### Step 3: Choose Tax Regions

Squarespace lets you specify which regions to collect tax:

- **US Automatic**: Uses TaxJar's rate database
- **Manual Rates**: Set your own percentages
- **No Tax**: For tax-free products or regions

For most US sellers, the automatic option is the safest choice—rates update automatically when laws change.

### Step 4: Set Up Tax Exemptions (If Needed)

Some products may be tax-exempt in certain states:
- Food items
- Clothing (in some states)
- Digital products (varies widely)

You can create product-level tax settings if you sell a mix of taxable and exempt items.

## Understanding Nexus for Squarespace Sellers

Before collecting sales tax, you need to establish **nexus**—a connection to a state that requires you to collect tax there.

### Physical Nexus

You have physical nexus if you:
- Live in the state
- Have employees there
- Store inventory there
- Attend trade shows or pop-ups

### Economic Nexus

Most states now have economic nexus thresholds. If you sell over a certain amount into a state, you must collect tax even with no physical presence.

**Common thresholds**:
- $100,000 in sales, OR
- 200 transactions

Each state sets its own rules. Some use only dollar amounts; others use only transaction counts; most use both.

### What This Means for Squarespace Sellers

When you're just starting out, you likely only need to collect tax in your home state (where you have physical nexus).

As you grow and cross economic thresholds in other states, you'll need to:
1. Register for a sales tax permit in that state
2. Configure Squarespace to collect tax there
3. File returns according to that state's schedule

## State-by-State: What Squarespace Sellers Should Know

### States Without Sales Tax

Five states have no statewide sales tax:
- Alaska (but local taxes may apply)
- Delaware
- Montana
- New Hampshire
- Oregon

If you ship to customers in these states, you generally won't collect sales tax.

### Origin vs. Destination States

**Origin-based states** (few): Tax rate based on where you ship from
- Arizona, California (partial), Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia

**Destination-based states** (most): Tax rate based on where the customer is located

Squarespace's automatic tax handles this for you, but understanding the concept helps when reviewing reports.

### States With Specific Rules

**California**: Has both state and district taxes, plus complex sourcing rules. Tax configuration can be tricky.

**Colorado**: Home rule cities can set their own rates and rules, creating compliance complexity.

**New York**: Clothing under $110 is exempt, requiring product-level settings.

## Filing and Remitting Sales Tax

Collecting tax is only half the job. You also need to file returns and remit the money to state authorities.

### Filing Frequency

States assign filing frequency based on your sales volume:
- **Monthly**: High-volume sellers
- **Quarterly**: Medium-volume sellers
- **Annual**: Low-volume sellers

You'll receive your filing schedule when you register for a permit.

### Using Squarespace Reports

Generate tax reports to prepare your filings:
1. Go to **Analytics** → **Sales**
2. Export order data for your filing period
3. Break down tax by state (Squarespace shows this in order details)

### Filing Deadlines

Most states follow predictable schedules:
- Monthly: Due around the 20th of the following month
- Quarterly: Due by the end of the month following the quarter
- Annual: Due by January 31

**Important**: Some states require filing even if you collected $0 in tax. Missing a zero-dollar filing can trigger penalties.

## Common Squarespace Tax Setup Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Enabling Tax at All

Some sellers skip tax collection because it seems complicated. This creates liability that compounds over time.

**Solution**: At minimum, enable tax collection for your home state immediately.

### Mistake 2: Collecting Tax Without Permits

Collecting sales tax without being registered is technically illegal in most states. You're taking money you may not be authorized to collect.

**Solution**: Register for permits before enabling collection in each state.

### Mistake 3: Using Manual Rates

Manually entered tax rates go stale when laws change. Rate changes happen frequently—sometimes multiple times per year.

**Solution**: Use Squarespace's automatic tax calculation whenever possible.

### Mistake 4: Forgetting About Shipping

Many states tax shipping charges. Squarespace's automatic tax should handle this, but verify by checking test orders.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Economic Nexus

Your Squarespace store can trigger economic nexus in multiple states quickly, especially if you sell higher-priced items.

**Solution**: Review your sales by state quarterly. Tools like Sails can track this automatically.

## Squarespace Tax Settings Checklist

Before you launch (or as soon as possible):

- [ ] Enable automatic tax calculation
- [ ] Enter correct business address
- [ ] Register for sales tax permit in home state
- [ ] Enable tax collection for home state
- [ ] Set up product-level exemptions if needed
- [ ] Run a test order to verify tax appears correctly

As you grow:

- [ ] Track sales by state monthly
- [ ] Monitor economic nexus thresholds
- [ ] Register for new permits when thresholds are crossed
- [ ] Add new states to your tax collection settings
- [ ] Keep records of all registrations and filings

## Handling Tax-Exempt Customers

Some customers may be tax-exempt:
- Resellers with valid certificates
- Nonprofits
- Government agencies

Squarespace doesn't have built-in exemption certificate management. For exempt sales:

1. Collect the exemption certificate directly
2. Store it securely (digital or paper)
3. Process the order without tax (manual adjustment or discount code)
4. Note the exemption reason in order notes

If you have many exempt customers, consider a dedicated tool for certificate management.

## Digital Products on Squarespace

If you sell digital products (downloadables, courses, memberships):

### Know the Rules

Digital product taxation varies dramatically by state:
- Some states don't tax digital goods at all
- Others tax everything digital
- Many have complex rules by product type

### Configure Product Settings

In Squarespace, you can set products as digital and configure their tax treatment separately from physical goods.

### Track Carefully

Digital sales still count toward economic nexus thresholds, even if the products aren't taxable in that state.

## When to Get Additional Help

Squarespace handles the basics well, but consider additional tools or professional help when:

- You sell in 10+ states
- You're approaching economic nexus thresholds
- You sell a mix of physical, digital, and subscription products
- You've received a notice from a state tax authority
- You need to track nexus exposure across multiple platforms

## Next Steps

1. **Audit your current setup**: Is tax enabled? Is it configured correctly?
2. **Check your home state registration**: Are you registered and filing?
3. **Review your sales geography**: Where are your customers located?
4. **Plan for growth**: Set up monitoring before you hit nexus thresholds
