Gumroad has become the go-to platform for creators selling digital products, courses, ebooks, and memberships. But when it comes to sales tax, many creators are confused about their obligations. Let's clear things up.

## Does Gumroad Collect Sales Tax?

Yes! As of 2026, Gumroad acts as a **marketplace facilitator** and handles sales tax collection and remittance for most US sales. This is great news for creators.

**What Gumroad handles:**
- Calculating the correct sales tax rate based on customer location
- Collecting sales tax at checkout
- Remitting that tax to the appropriate states
- Filing marketplace facilitator returns on your behalf

## What About Digital Products?

This is where it gets interesting. Whether your digital products are even taxable depends on the state:

### States That Tax Digital Products
Many states now tax digital goods, including:
- **Texas** - Digital goods are taxable
- **New York** - Digital products are taxable
- **Pennsylvania** - Digital downloads are taxable
- **Washington** - Digital goods and streaming taxable
- **Connecticut** - Digital goods taxable since 2019
- **Colorado** - Taxable with local variations

### States That Don't Tax Digital Products
Some states still exempt digital goods:
- **California** - Digital products generally exempt
- **Florida** - Most digital products exempt
- **Georgia** - Digital products often exempt
- **Missouri** - Generally exempt

**The challenge:** Gumroad needs to determine what you're selling to apply the right tax treatment. Make sure your product categorization is accurate.

## Your Remaining Obligations

Even with Gumroad handling collection, you may still need to:

### 1. Register for Sales Tax Permits

Some states require you to have a sales tax permit even when a marketplace handles collection. This varies by state, but it's often tied to:

- Where you live (home state)
- Where you have significant business presence
- States that require registration for record-keeping

### 2. File Returns (Sometimes)

A handful of states require sellers to file returns showing marketplace sales, even if the tax due is zero. This is a reporting requirement, not a payment requirement.

### 3. Track Your Overall Nexus

If you sell on multiple platforms or have your own website, you need to track your total sales by state. You might create economic nexus in states where your combined sales exceed thresholds (typically $100,000/year or 200 transactions).

### 4. Keep Records

Maintain records of:
- Sales by state
- Tax collected by Gumroad
- Product types and their taxability
- Any direct sales outside Gumroad

## What About Memberships and Subscriptions?

Gumroad Memberships are a popular feature for creators. Here's how sales tax works:

- **Recurring charges:** Sales tax is calculated and collected on each billing cycle
- **State variations:** Some states tax subscriptions, others don't
- **SaaS-like treatment:** In many states, recurring digital subscriptions are taxable as SaaS

The good news: Gumroad handles this complexity for you automatically.

## International Sales

Gumroad also handles VAT/GST for international sales:

- **EU:** VAT collected using the customer's country rate
- **UK:** VAT collected at 20%
- **Australia:** GST collected at 10%
- **Canada:** GST/HST/QST handled regionally

You don't need to register for VAT in the EU—Gumroad handles it as the merchant of record.

## Gumroad vs. Self-Hosted

If you're considering selling on your own site instead of Gumroad, here's the tax comparison:

| Feature | Gumroad | Self-Hosted |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Sales tax calculation | Automatic | You handle it |
| Tax collection | Automatic | You implement |
| Tax remittance | Gumroad handles | You file & pay |
| State registrations | Often minimal | Required in nexus states |
| International VAT | Handled | Complex to manage |

For most creators, Gumroad's marketplace facilitator status is a huge compliance advantage.

## Common Creator Mistakes

### Assuming All Digital Products Are Tax-Free

Many creators think "it's digital, so no sales tax." That's increasingly untrue. More states are taxing digital goods every year.

### Not Tracking Multi-Platform Sales

If you sell on Gumroad AND your own website AND Patreon, each platform handles tax differently. Your own site sales are your responsibility.

### Ignoring State Registration Requirements

Some states require registration even when a marketplace handles everything. Your home state almost certainly requires a business license and/or sales tax permit.

### Mixing Physical and Digital Products

If you sell physical merchandise (t-shirts, prints, books) alongside digital products, different tax rules may apply. Make sure Gumroad knows what's physical vs. digital.

## How to Check Your Gumroad Tax Records

1. Go to **Settings > Payments** in your Gumroad dashboard
2. Download your sales data (includes tax information)
3. Review the tax collected by state
4. Compare against your records

For end-of-year reporting, Gumroad provides tax documents and summaries.

## When You Need Extra Help

Consider using a tool like Sails if you:

- Sell on multiple platforms (Gumroad + website + others)
- Are approaching economic nexus thresholds in multiple states
- Sell a mix of digital and physical products
- Want to track your overall tax exposure across channels
- Need filing reminders for states that require returns

## The Bottom Line

Gumroad has made sales tax compliance much simpler for digital creators. They handle the hard parts—calculation, collection, and remittance. But you should still:

1. Understand whether your products are taxable in various states
2. Know if your home state requires registration
3. Keep records of all sales across platforms
4. Track your nexus exposure if you sell on multiple channels

For most small creators, Gumroad's marketplace facilitator status means you can focus on creating, not filing tax returns.
