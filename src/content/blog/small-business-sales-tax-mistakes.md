Sales tax compliance trips up even the most careful business owners. The rules are complex, they change constantly, and the penalties for mistakes can be steep. Here are the seven most common errors we see and how to avoid them.

## 1. Collecting Tax Before Registering

**The Mistake:** You start collecting sales tax from customers before you have a sales tax permit from the state.

**Why It's a Problem:** Collecting sales tax without authorization is illegal in most states. The money you collect doesn't technically belong to you until you're registered. If audited, you may face penalties even though you collected the right amount.

**The Fix:** Always register for a sales tax permit before collecting any tax. Most states offer free online registration through their Department of Revenue website.

## 2. Not Collecting Where You Have Nexus

**The Mistake:** You have nexus in a state (through inventory, employees, or economic thresholds) but aren't collecting tax there.

**Why It's a Problem:** You're personally liable for uncollected tax. States can assess back taxes plus penalties and interest, sometimes going back several years.

**The Fix:** Track your sales by state. When you approach economic nexus thresholds ($100K sales or 200 transactions in most states), register before you cross them. Tools like Sails can monitor your exposure automatically.

## 3. Collecting in States Where You Don't Have Nexus

**The Mistake:** You collect sales tax from customers in every state, even where you have no obligation to collect.

**Why It's a Problem:** This overcharges customers and creates a mess if they request refunds. It can also trigger unwanted attention from state tax authorities who wonder why you're collecting without registration.

**The Fix:** Only collect sales tax in states where you have nexus and are registered. For a small e-commerce business, this often starts as just your home state.

## 4. Using Incorrect Tax Rates

**The Mistake:** You charge a flat state rate without accounting for local taxes, or use outdated rates.

**Why It's a Problem:** Undercollecting means you pay the difference out of pocket. Overcollecting means unhappy customers and potential legal issues.

**The Fix:** Use address-based tax calculation. A customer in Los Angeles pays a different rate than one in San Diego, even though both are in California. Automated tax software handles this in real time.

## 5. Forgetting to File Zero Returns

**The Mistake:** You had no taxable sales in a state this period, so you skip filing a return.

**Why It's a Problem:** Most states require you to file even when you owe nothing. Missing a zero return can trigger late filing penalties, and accumulated penalties can add up quickly.

**The Fix:** Put your filing deadlines on your calendar and file every return, every time, even if the amount is $0.

## 6. Misclassifying Products

**The Mistake:** You assume all your products are taxable (or exempt) without checking the rules.

**Why It's a Problem:** Tax rules vary by product type and state. Clothing is exempt in Pennsylvania but taxable in most other states. Grocery food is exempt in many states but prepared food is taxable. Digital goods have wildly inconsistent treatment.

**The Fix:** Research your specific product categories in each state where you sell. When in doubt, err on the side of collecting tax, since it's easier to refund an overcharge than to explain why you didn't collect.

## 7. Not Keeping Records

**The Mistake:** You don't maintain documentation of your sales, exemption certificates, or tax filings.

**Why It's a Problem:** If audited, the burden of proof is on you. Without records, the state can estimate your liability, and their estimates rarely favor you.

**The Fix:** Keep records of:
- All sales transactions with customer addresses
- Exemption certificates from wholesale or resale buyers
- Copies of all filed returns
- Payment confirmations

Most states require you to retain records for 3-7 years.

## Bonus: The Marketplace Facilitator Confusion

Many sellers don't realize that marketplaces like Amazon, Etsy, and eBay now collect and remit sales tax on their behalf in most states. This is good news. It means less work for you.

**But here's the catch:** You're still responsible for sales through your own website and other direct channels. Don't assume that because Amazon handles your marketplace sales, you're covered everywhere.

## How to Get Compliant

If you've made any of these mistakes, don't panic. Most can be corrected:

1. **Register where needed** - Apply for permits in states where you have nexus
2. **File back returns** - Many states offer voluntary disclosure programs with reduced penalties
3. **Set up proper collection** - Use automated tools for accurate rate calculation
4. **Establish a filing schedule** - Mark deadlines and file consistently

The cost of getting compliant is almost always less than the cost of an audit.

## Prevention Is Easier Than Cure

Once you're set up correctly, sales tax becomes routine:
- Automated collection at checkout
- Scheduled monthly or quarterly filings
- Annual nexus review

The initial setup takes effort, but ongoing compliance is manageable even for small businesses.
