If you sell on Etsy, you might think sales tax is handled for you. That's partially true, but there's more to the story. Here's what every Etsy seller needs to know.

## The Good News: Etsy Collects Sales Tax for You

Since 2019, Etsy has been a "marketplace facilitator" in most states. This means Etsy automatically calculates, collects, and remits sales tax on your behalf for orders shipped to customers in states with marketplace facilitator laws.

As of 2026, this includes all states that have sales tax (45 states plus DC and Puerto Rico).

**What this means for you:**
- You don't need to calculate sales tax on Etsy orders
- You don't need to remit that tax to the states
- Etsy handles it automatically

## The Not-So-Good News: You Still Have Obligations

### 1. You May Still Need to File Returns

Even though Etsy remits the tax, some states still require you to file a sales tax return showing zero tax due for marketplace sales. This is called a "marketplace facilitation deduction."

States that commonly require this include:
- California
- New York
- Texas
- Florida

Check your state's requirements or use a tool like Sails to track your filing obligations.

### 2. Sales Outside Etsy

If you sell anywhere besides Etsy (your own website, craft fairs, local markets, other platforms), you're responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax on those sales yourself.

### 3. Business Licenses and Permits

You still need proper business licenses and sales tax permits in states where you have nexus. Etsy handling collection doesn't exempt you from registration requirements.

## Understanding Your Etsy Sales Tax Report

Etsy provides a sales tax report in your Shop Manager under **Finances > Legal and tax information > Sales tax**.

This report shows:
- Tax collected by state
- Orders where tax was applied
- Your gross sales by jurisdiction

Use this for your records and to reconcile with your accounting.

## When You Need a Sales Tax Permit

You need a sales tax permit if:

1. **You have physical nexus** in a state (you live there, have inventory there, etc.)
2. **You sell outside Etsy** in that state
3. **Your state requires it** even for marketplace-only sellers

Many states require a permit even if Etsy is doing all the collecting. It's about being registered as a business, not just about who remits the tax.

## Common Etsy Seller Mistakes

### Thinking You're Completely Off the Hook

Etsy handles collection and remittance, but you may still need to:
- File zero returns in some states
- Maintain sales tax permits
- Track your nexus exposure

### Not Tracking Multi-Channel Sales

If you sell on Etsy AND Shopify AND craft fairs, you need to track sales tax across all channels. Etsy only handles Etsy sales.

### Ignoring Business License Requirements

A sales tax permit is different from a business license. You may need both, depending on your state and local requirements.

## How Sails Helps Etsy Sellers

Even though Etsy handles the heavy lifting, Sails can help you:

- **Track nexus** across all your sales channels
- **Get filing reminders** for states that require returns
- **Generate reports** combining Etsy + other platform sales
- **Stay compliant** without the confusion

## The Bottom Line

Etsy has made life much easier for small sellers by handling sales tax collection. But don't assume you have zero obligations. Stay informed about your state's requirements, keep good records, and make sure you're properly registered where needed.
