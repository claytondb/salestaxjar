## Does Shopify Handle Sales Tax for You?

Short answer: **Partially.**

Shopify can calculate and collect sales tax at checkout—but only in states where you tell it to. And it doesn't:

- Track your economic nexus thresholds
- Register you with state tax authorities
- File your returns
- Remit the tax you collect

Those parts are still on you.

Let's break down exactly what Shopify does and what you need to handle yourself.

---

## What Shopify Tax Does

### Automatic Tax Calculation
Once configured, Shopify calculates the correct tax rate based on:
- Customer's shipping address
- Your store's location
- Product tax categories

### Collection at Checkout
Tax is added to orders automatically. Customers see it before paying.

### Tax Reports
Shopify generates reports showing how much tax you collected, broken down by jurisdiction.

### Basic Nexus Alerts
Shopify Tax will notify you when you're approaching economic nexus thresholds in certain states.

---

## What Shopify Doesn't Do

### State Registration
Before you can legally collect sales tax, you need a sales tax permit from each state. Shopify doesn't do this for you.

### Filing Returns
Every state has different filing requirements (monthly, quarterly, annually). You must file returns showing what you collected and remit payment.

### Tracking ALL Nexus Types
Shopify tracks economic nexus but doesn't consider:
- Physical nexus (inventory, employees, trade shows)
- Affiliate nexus
- Marketplace nexus (Amazon FBA, etc.)

### Multi-Channel Consolidation
If you sell on multiple platforms, Shopify only knows about Shopify sales. Your Amazon, Etsy, and wholesale channels aren't included.

## How to Set Up Shopify Tax

### Step 1: Enable Shopify Tax

1. Go to **Settings → Taxes and duties**
2. Click **Manage tax collection**
3. Select **Shopify Tax**

### Step 2: Set Up Your Store Location

Your "ship from" address affects tax rates in origin-based states:

1. Go to **Settings → Locations**
2. Verify your business address
3. This is where orders "ship from" for tax purposes

### Step 3: Configure Tax Collection Regions

You should only collect tax in states where you have nexus:

1. Go to **Settings → Taxes and duties**
2. Under "Tax regions," click **United States**
3. For each state where you have nexus, click **Collect sales tax**

**Important:** Don't enable all states "just to be safe." Collecting tax in a state where you're not registered can create problems.

### Step 4: Check Product Tax Categories

Some products have special tax treatment:

1. Go to **Products** and select a product
2. Scroll to **Tax category**
3. Choose the appropriate category (clothing, food, digital goods, etc.)

This matters because some states exempt certain products.

## Understanding Nexus with Shopify

### When Do You Have Nexus?

You likely have nexus in a state if:

1. **Physical presence:** Office, warehouse, employees, inventory
2. **Economic nexus:** Exceeded $100K in sales OR 200 transactions (varies by state)
3. **Affiliate nexus:** Marketing affiliates driving sales
4. **Marketplace nexus:** Inventory in Amazon FBA fulfillment centers

### Shopify's Nexus Tracking

Shopify Tax tracks economic nexus based on your Shopify sales. You'll see a notification when approaching thresholds.

**Limitation:** This only counts Shopify orders. If you also sell on Amazon, Etsy, or other channels, you need to combine that data manually.

### What to Do When You Hit Nexus

1. **Register with the state** (get a sales tax permit)
2. **Enable tax collection** in Shopify for that state
3. **Start collecting** on the next order
4. **File returns** on the state's schedule

## Common Shopify Tax Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Enabling Tax Collection Everywhere

If you collect tax in states where you're not registered, you're holding money you can't legally remit. This creates liability.

**Fix:** Only collect in states where you've registered for a permit.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Product Categories

Shopify defaults to "General - Taxable." But if you sell clothing, groceries, or digital products, you might be over-collecting in some states.

**Fix:** Set accurate product tax categories for every product.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting About Origin-Based States

In origin-based states (AZ, IL, MO, OH, PA, TN, TX, UT, VA), the rate is based on YOUR location, not the customer's.

**Fix:** Make sure your store location is correct in Settings.

### Mistake 4: Not Filing Returns

Collecting tax is step 1. You still have to file returns and remit what you collected. States notice when you register, collect, and never file.

**Fix:** Mark filing deadlines on your calendar or use a service that reminds you.

### Mistake 5: Relying Only on Shopify for Nexus

If you sell on multiple channels, Shopify only sees part of your sales. You might hit nexus in California from combined Shopify + Amazon sales.

**Fix:** Track all sales channels in one place.

## The Filing Process

### Monthly, Quarterly, or Annual?

States assign filing frequency based on how much tax you collect:
- **High volume:** Monthly (due ~20th of following month)
- **Medium volume:** Quarterly (due ~20th after quarter ends)
- **Low volume:** Annually (due January 20)

### How to File

1. Log into the state's tax portal
2. Enter sales, taxable sales, and tax collected
3. Pay what you owe
4. Keep confirmation for your records

### Using Shopify Reports

1. Go to **Analytics → Reports → Taxes**
2. Filter by state and date range
3. Export data for filing

**Tip:** The numbers might not match exactly due to refunds, exemptions, etc. Keep records of any adjustments.

## Multi-Channel Selling

### The Challenge

Selling on Shopify + Amazon + Etsy + your WooCommerce site? Each platform tracks sales separately. But nexus is based on TOTAL sales to a state.

**Example:**
- Shopify: $45K to California
- Amazon: $60K to California
- Total: $105K → You've exceeded the $100K threshold!

### The Solution

1. **Consolidate data:** Use a tool that pulls from all platforms
2. **Track thresholds:** Monitor combined sales by state
3. **Consider marketplace facilitator laws:** Amazon/Etsy handle tax for marketplace sales in most states

### Marketplace Facilitator Laws

As of 2024, nearly every state requires marketplace facilitators (Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Walmart) to collect and remit tax for third-party sales.

**What this means:**
- Amazon/Etsy collect tax on your behalf
- You still might need to file returns (showing $0 for marketplace sales)
- Direct website sales are still your responsibility

## When to Get Help

- You sell in 1-3 states
- Single sales channel
- Under $100K total sales
- Standard taxable products

### Consider Software If:
- 4+ states with nexus
- Multiple sales channels
- Complex product categories
- Approaching higher revenue

### Consider an Accountant If:
- Received a nexus letter from a state
- Multi-state filing is overwhelming
- Complex tax situations (B2B, exemptions)
- You need professional advice
