## What is Economic Nexus?

Economic nexus is a tax obligation that's created when your business exceeds certain sales thresholds in a state—even if you have no physical presence there.

Before 2018, you only had to collect sales tax in states where you had a physical presence (an office, warehouse, employees, etc.). The Supreme Court's *South Dakota v. Wayfair* decision changed everything.

Now, 45+ states can require you to collect and remit sales tax based purely on your sales volume to customers in that state.

**The bottom line:** If you sell online, you probably have tax obligations in states you've never visited.

## Economic Nexus Thresholds by State

Most states use one of two thresholds (you trigger nexus if you exceed EITHER):

- **$100,000 in sales** to customers in that state, OR
- **200 transactions** with customers in that state

However, thresholds vary. Here's the breakdown:

### States with $100K OR 200 Transaction Threshold
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, District of Columbia

### States with $100K Only (No Transaction Threshold)
California, Florida, New York (changed in 2025)

### States with Different Thresholds
- **Texas:** $500,000
- **California:** $500,000  
- **New York:** $500,000 and 100 transactions
- **Alabama:** $250,000

### States with No Sales Tax
- Alaska (no state tax, but local taxes may apply)
- Delaware
- Montana
- New Hampshire
- Oregon

## How Economic Nexus Works: A Real Example

Let's say you run an online store from Texas selling handmade candles.

**Year 1:**
- You sell $45,000 to California customers
- You sell $80,000 to New York customers  
- You sell $12,000 to Florida customers

**Result:** You haven't hit any state's threshold yet. No nexus.

**Year 2:**
- California sales hit $105,000
- New York sales hit $150,000

**Result:** You now have economic nexus in California (exceeded $100K threshold). You must:
1. Register for a California sales tax permit
2. Start collecting California sales tax on orders
3. File California sales tax returns
4. Remit collected tax to California

## When Does Economic Nexus Start?

This is where it gets tricky. Each state has different rules:

### Prospective States (most common)
You start collecting tax on the NEXT transaction after hitting the threshold.

### Retroactive States  
Some states want you to collect tax on the transaction that pushed you over the threshold.

### Lookback Periods
Most states look at sales over the previous 12 months OR the current calendar year—whichever comes first.

**Pro tip:** Start tracking your sales by state NOW, even if you're nowhere near thresholds. You don't want to discover you hit nexus six months ago.

## What Happens If You Don't Comply?

States are getting more aggressive about enforcement. Here's what you risk:

1. **Back taxes:** You owe the tax you should have collected, even if you never charged customers
2. **Penalties:** Typically 10-25% of unpaid taxes
3. **Interest:** Compounds monthly on unpaid amounts
4. **Audit costs:** Time and money defending yourself

States share data. Marketplace facilitators (Amazon, Etsy, eBay) report seller information. Payment processors can be subpoenaed. The "they'll never find me" strategy is increasingly risky.

## Types of Nexus (Beyond Economic)

Economic nexus isn't the only way to create tax obligations:

### Physical Nexus
Any physical presence in a state:
- Office or warehouse
- Employees working remotely
- Inventory stored in fulfillment centers (including Amazon FBA!)
- Trade show attendance

### Affiliate Nexus
Having affiliates or referral partners in a state who drive sales to your site.

### Click-Through Nexus
If a website in a state links to your store and you pay them commissions, some states consider this nexus.

### Marketplace Facilitator Laws
If you sell through Amazon, Etsy, eBay, or similar platforms, the marketplace collects and remits tax for you in most states. BUT you still may need to file returns showing $0 if you're registered.

## Step-by-Step: What to Do If You Have Economic Nexus

### Step 1: Determine Where You Have Nexus
Track your sales by state. Include all channels (your website, marketplaces, in-person).

### Step 2: Register for Sales Tax Permits
Apply through each state's Department of Revenue. This is typically free but takes 1-4 weeks.

**Important:** Don't start collecting tax until you have a valid permit number.

### Step 3: Configure Your Store
Set up sales tax collection for states where you're registered:
- Shopify: Settings → Taxes and Duties
- WooCommerce: Use a tax plugin
- BigCommerce: Built-in tax settings

### Step 4: Collect Tax on Orders
Your platform should automatically calculate and add tax to orders shipping to your nexus states.

### Step 5: File Returns and Remit Tax
Each state has its own:
- Filing frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually)
- Due dates (usually 20th of the month)
- Filing portal

### Step 6: Keep Records
Maintain records for at least 3-4 years:
- Sales by state
- Tax collected
- Returns filed
- Payments made

## Common Economic Nexus Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Only counting website sales
Your Etsy, Amazon, and wholesale sales count toward thresholds too.

### Mistake 2: Thinking marketplaces handle everything
Marketplaces collect tax, but you might still need to file returns showing those sales.

### Mistake 3: Registering too early
If you register before you have nexus, you might be required to file returns even with $0 sales.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring small states
It's easier to hit 200 transactions in Wyoming than $100K in sales. Track transactions too.

### Mistake 5: Using outdated rates
Tax rates change frequently. A "set it and forget it" approach leads to under/over collection.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need nexus to use Sails?
No! Our free tier helps you track when you're approaching thresholds—before you have nexus.

### What if I already have nexus in multiple states?
Start with states where you have the most sales. Register, configure collection, and work through your list.

### Can I register in all 50 states just to be safe?
You could, but then you'd have to file returns in all 50 states (even with $0 sales). Only register where you actually have nexus.

### What about product exemptions?
Some products (groceries, clothing, medicine) are tax-exempt in certain states. This adds complexity—make sure your tax solution handles product categories.

### How often do thresholds change?
States occasionally update thresholds. Texas raised theirs to $500K in 2024. We track these changes for you.
