🧵 Sales tax myth: "I only need to collect tax in my home state"

Wrong. Since 2018, you might owe tax in 45+ states.

Here's what online sellers need to know:

Tweet 2:
The Wayfair ruling let states tax you based on where your CUSTOMERS are.

This is "economic nexus."

Most states: $100K sales OR 200 transactions = you owe tax there.

Tweet 3:
Real example:

You're in Texas. You sell $110K to California customers. 

California can now require you to:
- Register for a sales tax permit
- Collect tax on CA orders
- File returns (monthly/quarterly)

Tweet 4:
The scary part: States share data with each other.

They know when you hit thresholds.

Letters arrive. Back taxes get assessed. Penalties add up.

Tweet 5:
The good news: You can track this yourself.

Know your sales by state. Watch the thresholds. Register BEFORE you get caught.

I built sails.tax to make this easier.

Free tier to track nexus. $9/mo to connect your store.

TaxJar: $99/mo
Avalara: Call for pricing (never a good sign)
Sails: $9/mo

Same core features. 90% less.

### r/shopify Post
**Title:** Finally figured out my sales tax situation - sharing what I learned

**Body:**
Been selling on Shopify for 2 years. Completely ignored sales tax because it seemed too complicated.

Then I got a letter from California. Not fun.

Here's what I wish I knew earlier:

1. **Economic nexus is real** - You owe tax based on where customers are, not where you are. Most states trigger at $100K or 200 orders.

2. **Shopify's built-in tax is basic** - It applies rates but doesn't track your nexus or tell you when to register.

3. **TaxJar is overkill for small sellers** - $99/mo when you're doing $5K/month in sales? No thanks.

I ended up using a newer tool called Sails (sails.tax) - it's $9/mo and does nexus tracking + connects to Shopify. The free tier just tracks nexus if that's all you need.

Main point: Don't ignore this like I did. At least track where your sales are going.

Happy to answer questions if anyone else is confused about this stuff.

### r/woocommerce Post
**Title:** Released a sales tax plugin for WooCommerce - looking for feedback

**Body:**
Hey WooCommerce folks,

I built a sales tax tool (Sails - sails.tax) and just finished the WooCommerce integration. Looking for beta testers who can give honest feedback.

**What it does:**
- Calculates sales tax at checkout using your customer's address
- Syncs orders for nexus tracking
- Shows which states you have tax obligations in
- Sends filing deadline reminders

**What I need:**
- Feedback on the plugin installation process
- Any bugs or edge cases
- Feature requests

Free tier available, no credit card needed.

Plugin download: sails.tax/dashboard/integrations/woocommerce

Anyone willing to test it out? I'll prioritize your feature requests.

### r/Entrepreneur Post
**Title:** Bootstrapped a SaaS to $0 MRR - here's what I learned about sales tax (the hard way)

**Body:**
Plot twist: This post isn't about my SaaS revenue. It's about the sales tax nightmare I discovered while building it.

When I started selling online, I thought sales tax was simple: charge tax in your state, done.

**Wrong.**

After the 2018 Wayfair Supreme Court ruling, states can now tax you based on where your customers are. Sell $100K to Californians? You owe California sales tax. Even if you've never been there.

This is called "economic nexus" and it affects basically every online seller.

**The incumbents are expensive:**
- TaxJar: $99-299/mo
- Avalara: "Contact sales" pricing

For a side project doing $3K/month? That's insane.

**So I built something simpler:**
Sails (sails.tax) - nexus tracking, tax calculator, platform integrations. Free tier for basics, $9/mo for full features.

Not trying to compete with enterprise solutions. Just helping small sellers who are currently using spreadsheets or guessing.

Would love feedback from this community. What features would actually help you?

## LinkedIn Post

```
Something most online sellers don't realize:

You might owe sales tax in states you've never visited.

Since the 2018 Wayfair ruling, 45+ states can require you to collect tax based on where your CUSTOMERS are - not where you are.

This is called "economic nexus."

Most thresholds: $100K in sales OR 200 transactions per state per year.

The problem? Tracking this manually is a nightmare. And tools like TaxJar cost $99-299/month.

That's why I built Sails - sales tax compliance designed for small sellers.

✅ Free nexus tracking
✅ Tax calculator with product categories
✅ Platform integrations (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.)
✅ Plans starting at $9/mo

If you sell online, check your nexus status. Better to know now than get a letter later.

**First Comment:**
Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I built Sails because I was terrified of sales tax compliance.

After getting a nexus letter from California, I learned about economic nexus the hard way. Existing tools were either too expensive or too complicated for my small store.

Sails is what I wish existed - simple, affordable, and actually explains what's happening.

Would love your feedback. What would make this more useful for you?
