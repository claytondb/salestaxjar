## Engagement Strategy

### Do:
- Read the full thread before responding
- Answer the actual question helpfully
- Share specific, useful information
- Mention Sails only if genuinely relevant
- Be transparent ("I built a tool that does this")

### Don't:
- Just drop a link and run
- Respond to old threads (>6 months)
- Be pushy or salesy
- Ignore the actual question to promote

### Template Response (adapt to each thread):

```
[Answer their specific question first]

For nexus tracking specifically, you have a few options:
- Shopify Tax shows basic nexus alerts but doesn't track thresholds in detail
- TaxJar/Avalara are comprehensive but start at $99/mo
- I built sails.tax for this exact problem - free nexus tracking, $9/mo for full features

Happy to answer more questions about sales tax compliance - learned a lot building this.
