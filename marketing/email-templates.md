## Welcome Sequence (Automated)

### Email 1: Welcome (Immediate)

**Subject:** Welcome to Sails! Let's simplify your sales tax 🌊

**Body:**

Hi {{name}},

Welcome to Sails! You've just taken the first step toward stress-free sales tax compliance.

Here's what you can do right now:

**1. Check your nexus status**  
→ [Dashboard → Nexus](https://sails.tax/nexus)  
See which states you might have tax obligations in.

**2. Try the tax calculator**  
→ [Dashboard → Calculator](https://sails.tax/calculator)  
Get accurate tax calculations for any state.

**3. Connect your store** (optional)  
→ [Settings → Platforms](https://sails.tax/settings#platforms)  
Link Shopify, WooCommerce, or other platforms for automatic tracking.

**Quick tip:** Even if you're not sure where you have nexus, start tracking your sales by state. It's better to know than to guess.

Questions? Just reply to this email. I read every one.

### Email 2: Value Reminder (Day 3)

**Subject:** Are you tracking your sales by state?

**Body:**

Hi {{name}},

Quick question: Do you know which states you're approaching nexus thresholds in?

Most sellers don't track this until it's too late—and then comes the letter from California or Texas asking for back taxes.

**The Wayfair reality:**  
45+ states can require you to collect sales tax based on where your customers are, not where you are.

Most thresholds: $100K in sales OR 200 transactions per state.

**2 minutes to check:**  
→ [See your nexus status](https://sails.tax/nexus)

If you sell through Shopify, WooCommerce, or another platform, connecting it takes ~60 seconds and gives you automatic tracking.

Stay ahead of the thresholds.

### Email 3: Feature Highlight (Day 7)

**Subject:** The hidden cost of getting sales tax wrong

**Body:**

Hi {{name}},

Let me tell you about a seller named Mike (name changed).

Mike sold handmade leather goods on Shopify. Business was good—$180K in 2024.

Then California sent a letter. He had exceeded nexus thresholds two years ago.

**The damage:**
- $12,000 in back taxes
- $2,400 in penalties  
- Months of stress

All because he didn't know about economic nexus.

**Don't be Mike.**

The fix is simple:
1. Track sales by state (Sails does this for free)
2. Register before you hit thresholds
3. Start collecting tax going forward

→ [Check your exposure now](https://sails.tax/nexus)

Prevention is always cheaper than penalties.

– David

P.S. If you've already exceeded thresholds somewhere, don't panic. Most states have voluntary disclosure programs. Reply and I'll point you in the right direction.

You've been using Sails for a couple weeks now. How's it going?
